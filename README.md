```
  @override
  chopper.Response<ResultType> convertResponse<ResultType, Item>(
      Response response) {
    if (response.bodyString.isEmpty) {
      // In rare cases, when let's say 204 (no content) is returned -
      // we cannot decode the missing json with the result type specified
      return chopper.Response(response.base, null, error: response.error);
    }

    final jsonRes = super.convertResponse(response);
    return jsonRes.copyWith<ResultType>(
        body: $jsonDecoder.decode<Item>(jsonRes.body) as ResultType);
  }
